### ArtmoGraph

IoT & AI-powered system that transforms live environmental data into stunning generative art.

ArtmoGraph combines sensor-driven IoT, AI language models, and generative image technology to visualize real-time atmospheric conditions as digital artwork.
It demonstrates how climate data can inspire creativity, making environmental awareness both interactive and beautiful.

Developed as a major project for BCA Semester 6 under the Department of Computer Science, CHRIST (Deemed to be University).

### Features

- Real-time data collection with ESP32 + DHT22 (temperature & humidity) + BMP280 (pressure)
- Creative prompt generation using LLaMA 3.2B on an AWS GPU instance
- AI image creation via Stable Diffusion (AUTOMATIC1111)
- Web server display through Apache, accessible from any device
- Automated pipeline from sensor input to browser output

### Quick Start

- Hardware Setup
	1.	Wire the ESP32 to DHT22 & BMP280 sensors.
	2.	Flash the ESP32 with esp32/sensor_publish.ino using Arduino IDE.
	3.	Update WiFi + MQTT broker IP in the code.

- Deploy AWS EC2
	1.	Navigate to terraform/: ```terraform init
				           terraform apply```


	2.	This provisions a GPU EC2 instance with security groups for MQTT & HTTP.

- Set up Server
	1.	SSH into your EC2 instance.
	2.	Clone this repo and install requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
	3.	Start your pipeline: ```python3 server/mqtt_listener.py```



- View Your Art
	•	Open your EC2 public IP in a browser.
	•	See real-time evolving artwork based on your environment!

- Future Enhancements
	•	Additional sensors (air quality, UV index, wind speed)
	•	User controls for style & themes
	•	Cloud storage of generated artwork history (S3)
	•	Mobile app for live viewing & downloads
	•	Predictive AI to generate art based on forecasts
